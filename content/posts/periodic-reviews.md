Periodic reviews, a cornerstone of the Getting Things Done (GTD) system, keep your projects and tasks updated and provide a space for personal reflection. This reflective aspect allows you to reassess your goals and priorities.

You might review daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly depending on your needs. It is essential to make it a habit to stay organized and focused.
