The plank test is a simple and effective exercise to test your core strength. It involves holding a plank position for as long as possible. The plank test can be done on your elbows or hands, with the elbows version slightly more challenging.

Here's how to evaluate the plank test on your elbows:

| Beginner | Intermediate | Advanced | Elite |     |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | ----- | --- |
| < 60     | < 120        | < 180    | > 180 |     |
