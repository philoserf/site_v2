The STAR method is a framework for answering behavioral interview questions in a structured and effective way. It stands for:

**S** - **Situation**: Set the context for the story you're about to tell. Describe the situation, including the relevant details.\
**T** - **Task**: Explain your task or problem in that situation. Be specific about what needs to be done.\
**A** - **Action**: Describe your actions to address the task or problem. Focus on what you did rather than what others did.\
**R** - **Result**: Share the outcome of your actions. What did you achieve? What did you learn?
