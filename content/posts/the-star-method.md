The STAR method is a framework for answering behavioral interview questions in a structured and effective way. It stands for:

S - Situation: Set the context for the story you're about to tell. Describe the situation, including the relevant details.\
T - Task: Explain your task or problem in that situation. Be specific about what needs to be done.\
A - Action: Describe your actions to address the task or problem. Focus on what you did rather than what others did.\
R - Result: Share the outcome of your actions. What did you achieve? What did you learn?
