A link may be relevant for many reasons:

- x _is an instance of_ y
- x _is a subset of_ y
- x _is a semantic dependency of_ P (x is a part of proposition P; without x, P makes no sense)
- x _is isomorphic to_ y (shares the same formal structure)
- x _is an analogy_ of y

Four principles can make the cognitive architecture:

- Separate functions,
- Have a constructivist mindset,
- Use prose to think, and
- Make your links explicit.
