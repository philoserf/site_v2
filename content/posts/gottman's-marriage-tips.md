- Seek help early. Instead of waiting six years before looking for outside assistance, seek help as soon as a problem becomes known.
- Edit yourself. Honesty is essential, but knowing every critical or negative thought hurts your partner.
- Soften your "start-up." When a problem arises, instead of beginning with an angry confrontation, bring up your concerns gently and carefully.
- Accept influence. Both parties need to be able to accept and change feelings and plans due to the influence of the other party.
- Have high standards. Only tolerate lousy behavior once it reaches a breaking point. Hold yourselves and one another to the highest reasonable standard.
- Learn to repair or exit the argument. If it isn't getting anywhere, change the subject, make a humorous or caring remark to lighten the mood, establish common ground, and back down when necessary. If it is especially heated, agree to take a 20-minute recess to cool down and then re-approach the situation with more level heads.
- Focus on the bright side. Cultivate a positive climate rather than a negative one in your marriage. Continually say kind and loving things to your partner and about your relationship. These affirmations will only become more accurate with time.
