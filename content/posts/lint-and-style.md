Shared style and lint standards are essential in software projects for several reasons:

1. Consistency: Shared style and lint standards help ensure that code is consistently written across the project. This makes it easier for developers to read and understand each other's code, which can reduce the likelihood of bugs and improve the overall maintainability of the project.
2. Improved code quality: Lint tools can help enforce best practices and catch potential issues before they become problems. This can improve the overall quality of the code and reduce the likelihood of bugs and security vulnerabilities.
3. Improved collaboration: Shared style and lint standards can help facilitate collaboration between developers, especially in large and complex projects where many developers work on the same codebase. Having a standard set of guidelines makes it easier for developers to work together and reduces the likelihood of merge conflicts.
4. Increased productivity: Shared style and lint standards can make development more efficient. Developers can focus on writing code that follows best practices rather than worrying about whether their code is written in the correct style.

Introducing shared standards, especially in an established codebase, can be a challenging process, and it's not uncommon for developers to resist change. Here are a few strategies that can help overcome resistance to the introduction of shared standards:

1. Lead by example: If you're in a leadership role, you must set a good example and follow the new standards yourself. This will demonstrate the benefits of the standards and encourage others to follow suit.
2. Foster a culture of continuous improvement: Encourage your team to view the introduction of new standards as an opportunity to improve the quality of their code and make their work more efficient. Emphasize that the goal is to make everyone's work more accessible and enjoyable rather than adding more work.
3. Provide resources and support: Ensure your team has the help and support they need to implement the new standards. This may include training, documentation, and tools that make it easier to follow the standards.
4. Gradual adoption: Consider introducing the standards gradually rather than all at once. This can make the transition less overwhelming for your team and give them time to adjust.
5. Address concerns: Encourage open and honest feedback, and take the time to listen to and address any concerns that your team may have. If a particular standard is causing specific difficulties, consider adjusting it or providing additional support to help your team overcome the challenges.
