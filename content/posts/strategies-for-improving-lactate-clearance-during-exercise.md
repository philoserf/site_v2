- Increase aerobic capacity: Regularly perform aerobic exercises to enhance your body's ability to use oxygen efficiently.
- High-intensity interval training (HIIT): Incorporate HIIT sessions to improve lactate threshold and clearance.
- Tempo training: Include workouts slightly below your lactate threshold to improve your body's ability to process lactate.
- Active recovery: During rest periods, engage in light activity to help clear lactate more effectively.
- Proper nutrition: Ensure adequate carbohydrate intake to support energy metabolism.
- Stay hydrated: Proper hydration helps maintain blood volume and supports lactate clearance.
- Progressive overload: Gradually increase workout intensity and duration to adapt to higher lactate levels.
- Strength training: Build muscle mass to increase lactate buffering capacity.
