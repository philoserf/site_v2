Request for Comment:\
Realistic Income Model: a Traveller House Rules Expansion

The following is a proposed house rule for adding realism and complexity to the economics of the Traveller universe. I am indebted to the work done by the creators of the Trillion Credit Squadron and others whose contributions I do not remember.

Base Income: CR10,000

| Tech Level | Port |     |     |     | (%) |
| ---------- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|            | A    | B   | C   | D   | X   |
| E          | 170  | 150 | 130 | 98  | 65  |
| D          | 160  | 140 | 120 | 90  | 60  |
| C          | 150  | 130 | 110 | 82  | 55  |
| B          | 140  | 120 | 100 | 75  | 50  |
| A          | 130  | 110 | 90  | 68  | 45  |
| 9          | 120  | 100 | 80  | 60  | 40  |
| 8          | 110  | 90  | 70  | 52  | 35  |
| 7          | 100  | 80  | 60  | 45  | 30  |

| Trade | (%) |
| ----- | --- |
| Ag    | 120 |
| In    | 140 |
| Na    | 80  |
| Ni    | 80  |
| Po    | 80  |
| Ri    | 160 |

| Social Class | (%)  |
| ------------ | ---- |
| C            | 2169 |
| B            | 1171 |
| A            | 633  |
| 9            | 342  |
| 8            | 185  |
| 7            | 100  |
| 6            | 85   |
| 5            | 72   |
| 4            | 61   |
| 3            | 52   |

Usage: Base Income + Tech Port Mod + all Trade Mods \* Social Mod

Comments:\
Base income of CR10,000 comes from T4 retirement pay after eight terms.\
Class C port at tech level 11 (average imperial) is the starting point.\
Ports class C or better, a step in tech level equals a 10% gain in income.\
Ports class B and A equal a 20% gain in income over the lower port.\
Class D ports equal 75% of a class C port of the same tech level.\
No port equals 50% of a class C port of the same tech level.\
Trade modifications are from Trillion Credit Squadron.\
Social levels below 7 are 15% lower than the next higher social level.\
Social levels above 7 are 85% greater than the next lower social level.\
Anything not included on the chart is the realm of the referee.

Examples:\
John Normal is an average citizen (SS 7)\
Lord Bern is a Baron (SS C)\
Bill Labor is a minimum wage worker (SS 3)

On an average imperial planet with a class C port and an average imperial technology level, John Normal makes Cr10,000, Lord Bern makes MCr21.96, and Bill Labor makes Cr5200.

On a rich, agricultural planet with a class A port and a high imperial technology level of 14, John Normal makes Cr32,640, Lord Bern makes MCr70.79, and Bill Labor makes Cr16,973.

On a non-agricultural, non-industrial planet with no port and 1970s technology level, John Normal makes Cr1920, Lord Bern makes MCr4.16, and Bill Labor makes Cr998.

Notes on other uses:\
Income for social level 7 can be used as per capita GDP.\
The general tax burden can be 10% + government level.
