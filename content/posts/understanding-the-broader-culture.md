You couldn't understand the broader culture if you didn't watch television before the 2020s, and you can't understand world culture if you didn't follow social media after the 2020s. I don't recommend trying to understand the broader culture. Forget TV and social media. They don't serve you or the culture around you; they create it. You will do fine responding to your local environment without the context TV or social media provide.
