This story will end one day. We cannot know when or what that ending will be. It may have a grand finale and pleasant resolution. It may peter out, forgotten and unworthy of further effort. The action may be building or falling: mid-sentence, stop, unfulfilled, and unfulfilling. Such is the nature of real life. Stories that have yet to end before their telling begins.

This story will never have a better beginning than these words now. There is too much to catch up on, with events that have already occurred, are happening now, and will happen soon. If we don't start now as we have, we will never catch up. So, we go on now as we must get this story told. The urgency of storytelling is upon us, and we must share our stories before they slip away.
