Like life, this story will end. We can't predict when or how. It may have a grand finale and satisfying conclusion or fade away, forgotten and unworthy of attention. The action can intensify or collapse abruptly, leaving us mid-sentence, unfulfilled. This is real life—stories unfold before they begin and disappear quickly.

This story can start with these words. There's much to discuss—past, present, and future events. If we don't begin now, we'll never keep up. We must continue now, driven by the urgency of storytelling. We must share our stories before they slip away and are lost to time.
