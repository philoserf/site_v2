Like life itself, this story will eventually come to an end. We can't predict when or what that ending will be. It might have a grand finale and a satisfying conclusion or fade away, forgotten and unworthy of further attention. The action can build up or fall apart abruptly, leaving us mid-sentence, unfulfilled and unfulfilling. This is the nature of real-life—stories unfold before they even begin.

This story has an opportunity to begin with these words. There's much to catch up on—events that have happened, are happening right now, and will happen soon. If we don't begin now, as we have, we'll never be able to keep up. We must continue now, driven by the urgency of storytelling. We must share our stories before they slip away and are lost to time.
