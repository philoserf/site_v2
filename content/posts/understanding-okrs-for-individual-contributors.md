- Alignment with team/company goals: Your OKRs should always tie back to your team's and the organization's broader goals. It's not about solely your tasks but how they contribute to the bigger picture.
- Focus on impact: Individual OKRs should emphasize the outcomes or value you aim to create rather than just a list of activities. How does your work make a difference?
- Stretch goals: OKRs are meant to be aspirational. Setting challenging goals that push you to grow and achieve more is okay. Typically, hitting about 70% of your key results is a success.
- Flexibility: Individual OKRs can be iterated upon and changed more frequently than team or company-wide OKRs.Review and adjust as needed.

## Example OKRs for Individual Contributors: Software Engineer

- Objective: Improve customer onboarding experience.
  - Key Result 1: Decrease average onboarding time by 20%.
  - Key Result 2: Increase onboarding completion rate to 90%.
  - Key Result 3: Achieve a customer satisfaction rating of 4.5/5 for onboarding.

## Tips for Setting Effective Individual OKRs

- Collaborate with your manager: Your OKRs should support your manager's goals and the team's focus. Open communication is essential.
- Specificity is critical. Key results must be measurable and clearly defined. Avoid vague goals or task descriptions.
- Limit the number: Try to stick to 1-2 objectives with around three critical results per objective. Focusing on fewer goals provides more profound clarity.
- Regular check-ins: Review your OKRs with your manager continuously, discussing progress and making necessary adjustments.

## Important Considerations

While OKRs can be very useful for individual contributors, it's essential to acknowledge some potential concerns:

- Focus on Outcomes, Not Output: Don't get overly tied to completing tasks. OKRs are ultimately about impact.
- Avoid Individual Performance Reviews: OKRs should not be used as the sole basis of performance evaluations. Consider them one tool along with other forms of feedback and assessment.
- The Risk of Tunnel Vision: Ensure individual OKRs don't lead to employees working in silos and neglecting collaborative opportunities.
