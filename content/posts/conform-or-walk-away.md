Observation: We often conform to what we see others doing or walk away.\
Conclusion: We should better model what we'd like from others and be less adaptive.\
Questions: Is that true? Is adaption a valuable skill for me? Would modeling the behavior we want be beneficial?

1. Analyze the situation before deciding to conform or walk away.
2. Ask yourself what behavior you want to model and why.
3. Think about what the potential consequences of conforming or walking away might be.
4. Create strategies and alternatives to conforming or walking away that could be useful in different situations.
5. Question how you can positively influence the situation by modeling your desired behavior.
6. Practice role-playing different scenarios to become more comfortable and confident when encountering similar situations.
7. Develop a better understanding of the value of adaptation and how it can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context.
8. Consider attending workshops or classes that can help you better understand the concept of adaptation and how to use it to your advantage.
