One approach to establishing healthy routines is to start small. Pick one or two habits you want to incorporate into your daily routine and focus on those for a week or two. Once those habits have become ingrained, you can add one or two more. It is essential to be consistent with the timing of your routines, so try to stick to the same schedule as much as possible. It can be helpful to use reminders, whether setting the alarm or having a visual reminder, to help you stay on track. Another tip is to set realistic goals and not be too hard on yourself if you slip up. Building healthy habits takes time and effort, and making mistakes is okay.
