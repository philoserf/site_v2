Anything in the world when you are born is normal and is just a natural part of how the world works.\
Anything invented between the ages of fifteen and thirty-five is new, exciting, and revolutionary; you can make a career out of it.\
Anything invented after age thirty-five is disruptive, challenging the established order of things.
