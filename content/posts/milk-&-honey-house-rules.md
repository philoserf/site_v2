- No name-dropping, no star fucking.
- No hooting, hollering, shouting, or other loud behavior.
- No fighting, play fighting, no talking about fighting.
- Gentlemen will remove their hats. Hooks are provided.
- Gentlemen will refrain from introducing themselves to ladies. Ladies, start a conversation or ask the bartender to teach you. If a man you don't know speaks to you, please lift your chin slightly and ignore him.
- Do not linger outside the front door.
- Do not bring anyone unless you leave that person alone in your home. You are responsible for the behavior of your guests.
- Exit the bar briskly and silently. People are trying to sleep across the street. Please make all your travel plans and say all your farewells before leaving the bar.
