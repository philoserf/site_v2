The term _administrivia_ dates from 1922, when Harlen Fiske Stone, future Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, used it to describe the duties of a law school dean. The term has since come to refer to the mundane tasks that must be done to keep an organization running. It is often used in a pejorative sense to describe unnecessary or overly bureaucratic functions.
