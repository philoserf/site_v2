The primary concentrations of English-speaking expat retirees in Italy tend to be in:

1. Tuscany: Particularly cities like Florence and smaller towns in the countryside.
2. Umbria: Often called "the new Tuscany," it attracts retirees seeking a quieter lifestyle.
3. Le Marche: An increasingly popular region on the Adriatic coast.
4. Lake Como: In northern Italy, it is known for its beautiful scenery and upscale communities.
5. Sicily: Especially in areas like Taormina and Syracuse.
6. Puglia: The "heel" of Italy's boot is gaining popularity among retirees.
7. Abruzzo: Attracting those looking for a more authentic Italian experience at lower costs.
8. Liguria: Particularly in coastal areas like the Cinque Terre.

These areas are popular due to their pleasant climate, beautiful landscapes, rich culture, and relatively lower cost of living than significant cities. Would you like more information on any of these regions or aspects of expat retirement in Italy?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
