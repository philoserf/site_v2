The primary concentrations of English-speaking expat retirees in Italy tend to be in:

1. Tuscany: Particularly cities like Florence and smaller towns in the countryside.
2. Umbria: Often called "the new Tuscany," it attracts retirees seeking a quieter lifestyle.
3. Le Marche: An increasingly popular region on the Adriatic coast.
4. Lake Como: In northern Italy, it is known for its beautiful scenery and upscale communities.
5. Sicily: Especially in areas like Taormina and Syracuse.
6. Puglia: The "heel" of Italy's boot is gaining popularity among retirees.
7. Abruzzo: Attracting those looking for a more authentic Italian experience at lower costs.
8. Liguria: Particularly in coastal areas like the Cinque Terre.
9. Rome: The capital city has a large expat community but can be more expensive than other regions.
