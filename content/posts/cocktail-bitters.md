Cocktail bitters are spirits infused with flavors, typically from plants, fruits, or spices. They date back to the early 1800s and were initially used to assist with digestion and cure stomach aches. Infusing your spirits allows you to control the flavor and strength of the bitters.

Angostura bitters are the most common in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, Manhattan, and Pisco Sour. Other famous bitters brands include Peychaud's, Regans', and Fee Brothers.

Pechaud's bitters are a vital ingredient in the Sazerac cocktail, while Regans' orange bitters are used in the classic Martini. Fee Brothers' bitters come in various flavors, such as rhubarb, grapefruit, and black walnut, allowing you to experiment with different tastes in your cocktails.

For those seeking a truly unique and creative flavor experience, artisanal bitters brands like Scrappy's Bitters and Bittermens are a treasure trove. With flavors like lavender, cardamom, and cherry bark vanilla, these bitters can add a new dimension of depth and complexity to your cocktails, elevating the overall drinking experience and inspiring you to push the boundaries of mixology.
