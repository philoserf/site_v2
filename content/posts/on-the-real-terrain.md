The clouds make a new terrain\
And the mind seeks to map this\
To an imagined real terrain below

Then

Clouds break\
And the mind maps\
The snow and the cloud\
Getting wrong the depth\
Mistaking one for the other\
And the other for the one

All shifting imagination\
At these thirty-five thousand feet
