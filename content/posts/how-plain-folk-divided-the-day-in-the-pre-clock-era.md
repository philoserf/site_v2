## Solar Markers

- Sunrise: A crucial starting point, often marking the beginning of the workday.
- Midday: Marked by the sun at its zenith, this was a natural breakpoint for rest and a meal.
- Sunset: Signaled at the end of the workday and the beginning of the evening.

## Activities

- Farming Communities: The day revolved around agricultural work. The sun's position dictated tasks like planting, tending livestock, harvesting, etc.
- Market Towns: Market days were a significant timekeeping event, with the flow of activity leading up to and after the market influencing the sense of time.
- Mealtimes: Meals, even if simple, provided a rhythm to the day. A mid-morning break, a bigger meal at midday, and supper in the evening likely punctuated people's lives.

## Observances

- Monastic Influence: The ringing of church bells for prayer times like Matins (morning), Vespers (evening), etc., imparted a sense of time even to those outside the monastery.
- Holy Days: Religious festivals and holy days provided a recurring calendar distinct from the daily rhythm.

## Natural Signs

- Birdsong: Different birds are active at different times of the day. The sounds of birdsong and their changes would have signaled a rough sense of time.
- Shadows: The length and direction of shadows cast by the sun were natural "clocks" for estimating the time of day.
- Bodily sensations: Hunger, tiredness, and the body's internal rhythms likely played a more significant role in time awareness than we experience today.

## Considerations

- Fluidity: Time wasn't about precise hours but broader periods of activity tied to light levels.
- Seasonal Variation: Days were longer in summer and shorter in winter, significantly affecting the length of the workday and how time was experienced.
- Regional Differences: Specific customs, the type of work, and local traditions would all impact how different communities divided their days.
