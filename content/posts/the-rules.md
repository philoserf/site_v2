## Keep it simple or Make it when you need it

- If it has a name, do not give it another name.
- Do not give it a different alias if you have given it a name.
- Start with one note until you need another note.
- Split content to a new note when its scope warrants separation.
- Start with one folder until you need another folder.
- Create a subfolder when the content hierarchy demands it.

## Surrender or Have a reason

- Adapt to the default configuration.
- After a sincere effort to adapt fails, modify the default configuration.
- Review your configurations (both Obsidian and Go) for cruft from time to time.

## Todo

- \[ ] Add _why_ & provide examples
- \[ ] Add more rules by others that align with these principles
- \[ ] Add section on when to break these rules
- \[ ] Include real-world case studies
