The generation effect is a psychological phenomenon where individuals better remember information they have actively generated themselves than information they have read or heard. This effect is robust across various types of information and tasks, including word lists, sentences, and problem-solving activities. The generation effect highlights the importance of active engagement in learning processes, suggesting that actively creating or producing material leads to more muscular memory retention than passive consumption.
