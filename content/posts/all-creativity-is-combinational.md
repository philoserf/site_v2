The statement "all creativity is combinational" originates from the work of cognitive scientist Margaret A. Boden. In her 2004 book, _The Creative Mind: Myths and Mechanisms_, Boden discusses different types of creativity, including combinational creativity. She argues that creativity often involves combining existing ideas, concepts, or elements in novel ways. This idea aligns with a broader view in cognitive science and psychology that sees creativity as a process of recombination and reconfiguration of existing knowledge and experiences.
