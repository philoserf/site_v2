title: Now
---

I am taking time off to enjoy family and road trips.

I am …

- trying to sleep, move, eat, grow, & share each day
- expecting to live, laugh, cry, & eventually die
- grateful for
  - my wife, family, & friends
  - plants in the garden
  - summer heat
  - a recent road trip through the Appalachian mountains
- looking forward to
  -  
  - a weekend in Chicago
  - visiting the Pacific Northwest
  - the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao

My current pastimes are …

- building strength, stability, & stamina
- craft cocktails
- reading
- golfing
