I am …

- trying to sleep, move, eat, grow, & share each day
- expecting to live, laugh, cry, & eventually die
- grateful for
  - springtime, April showers, May flowers
  - a recent long-haul drive across the Appalachian mountains and back
- looking forward to
  - subtle changes to my daily routines
  - the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao

My current pastimes are …

- golfing
- craft cocktails
- intentions around sleeping, moving, eating, growing, & sharing
- reading
- programming in Go

My current technical toolset includes …

- iPhone & iOS, iPad & iPadOS, MacBook & macOS
- zsh, vscode
- GitHub
- Obsidian, see <https://notes.philoserf.com/>
- Readwise & Readwise Reader
