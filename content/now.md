title: Now
---

I am taking time off to enjoy family and road trips.

I am …

- trying to sleep, move, eat, grow, & share each day
- expecting to live, laugh, cry, & eventually die
- grateful for
  - plants in the garden, summer heat
- looking forward to
  - all the little changes ahead
  - a weekend in Chicago
  - visiting the pacific northwest
  - the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao

My current pastimes are …

- building strength, stability, & stamina
- craft cocktails
- reading
- golfing
