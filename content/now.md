title: Now
---

I am …

- trying to sleep, move, eat, grow, & share each day
- expecting to live, laugh, cry, & eventually die
- grateful for
  - early summer, plants in the garden, weather
  - wins, losses, challenges, and the easy stuff too
- looking forward to
  - a quick trip to Las Vegas
  - all the little changes ahead
  - the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao

My current pastimes are …

- golfing
- craft cocktails
- intentions around sleeping, moving, eating, growing, & sharing
- reading
- programming in the Go language
