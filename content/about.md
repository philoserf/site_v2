title: About
---

Mark Ayers isn't your average small-town resident. Though he calls Rockford, Michigan, home, his life has been a restless tapestry woven across the country. From gritty Seattle neighborhoods to sunny Italian coasts, his passport boasts stories from Jamestown, New York, to bustling Istanbul, Turkey. He's navigated the suburbs of Atlanta and Columbus and planted roots on a few US Army bases along the way.

More than just a globe-trotter, Mark is a builder. Armed with a political science degree, he crafts processes and automation for Hypori, leaving his mark on everything from Subsplash's tech systems to ESPN's March Madness madness. He's tackled mobile apps at Nordstrom and delved into cloud computing with Samsung.

But Mark's passion isn't limited to code and clouds. He's a dedicated public servant, having served with honor as an enlisted infantryman and, later, as a Ranger-qualified officer. In civilian life, he's given back by leading his local library board, recruiting star speakers for writers' conferences, and steering non-profit organizations to success.

Mark Ayers is a man of service, a builder of progress, and a testament to the human spirit's wanderlust. He's not just a resident of Rockford, Michigan; he's a citizen of the world, leaving his footprint on communities and code alike.
