This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) using Ben Balter's [Retlab](https://github.com/benbalter/retlab/) theme. It is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), and cached by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The source code is available on [GitHub](<https://github.com/philoserf/site).

Most of my writing begins with pen on paper. I capture, edit, and refine on iOS, iPadOS and macOS using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
