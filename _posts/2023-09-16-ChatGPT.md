PROMPT: Could you rewrite The Cask of Amontillado by Edgar Allen Poe in the style of Earnest Hemingway?

Montresor had long been friends with Fortunato. But the former felt a great sense of injury from the latter, and so he vowed revenge. One evening, during carnival season, Montresor encounters Fortunato and shows his concern for the other man's health, pretending that he is worried about the dampness of the catacombs. Fortunato, who prided himself on his knowledge of wine, was quickly lured into the trap. Montresor led him deep into the catacombs, where he began to wall him up while listening to the jester's pitiful cries. Not until he had nearly finished Montresor finally heard Fortunato's silence.

PROMPT: How about in the style of J.R.R. Tolkien?

In the days of yore, when the world was young, and the shadows of evil had not yet consumed the hearts of men, there lived a dwarf named Montresor. His people had long dwelt in the deep places of the earth, where they delved for gems and precious metals. But Montresor harbored a grievance in his heart, for he had been wronged by a man of high estate: Fortunato, a lord of the city above.

And so, Montresor hatched a plot to exact revenge upon his foe. He invited Fortunato to the catacombs beneath the city, where he knew the promise of rare and fine wine would lure the lord. But it was a trap, for Montresor had long planned to entomb his enemy in the depths of the earth.

And so it came to pass that Montresor led Fortunato ever deeper into the winding tunnels of the catacombs until they finally came to a great vault, where the cask of Amontillado lay waiting. But as Fortunato reached for the wine, Montresor seized upon his moment of vengeance. Brick by brick, he walled up the entrance to the vault, heedless of the cries of his victim, until at last, the deed was done, and Fortunato was entombed forevermore.

One night, as the city was at its height of merrymaking, Montresor approached Fortunato with a false concern for his health. He warned of the dank and musty air of the catacombs, where the finest wines lay waiting to be tasted. And so, with the promise of a rare and precious vintage, Montresor led his unwitting victim into the depths of the earth.

And there, in the shadows of the catacombs, Montresor exacted his revenge. Brick by brick, he built a tomb around Fortunato, heedless of the jester's cries for mercy. And so it was that Montresor achieved his dark victory, forever entombing his hapless victim in the depths of the earth.

PROMPT: And as written by Shakespeare?

Enter Montresor, a man of noble bearing and troubled heart.

MONTRESOR:
Good evening, fair citizens. Tonight, I am tormented by a most grievous matter. My dear friend, Fortunato, has wronged me greatly, and I cannot suffer this injustice to go unpunished.

Thus, I have hatched a plan to exact revenge upon him. I will lure him into the catacombs beneath the city with the promise of fine wine, and there I shall wall him up, brick by brick until he meets his just deserts.

He exits, leaving Fortunato to his fate.
