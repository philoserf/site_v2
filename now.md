I am …

… grateful for

- the autumn with all the changes it brings each day
- my recent long-haul drive from Portland Oregon to Michigan

… looking forward to

- a short getaway with my wife
- subtle changes to my daily routines 

… am anticipating

- the total Solar eclipse on 2024-04-08 as seen from Mazatlán
- the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao
