I am …

… grateful for

- the autumn with all the changes it brings each day

… looking forward to

- driving my eldest son's car across the country as he begins his new job in the Midwest
- a short getaway with my wife as soon as I return from the drive

… looking into the future for

- the total Solar eclipse on 2024-04-08 as seen from Mazatlán
- the total Solar eclipse on 2026-08-12 as seen from Bilbao
